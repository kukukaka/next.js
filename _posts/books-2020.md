**The Culture Map**

The book I read this year that I enjoyed most. 

It helped me to understand different expectations at work based on the participants culture. The book is full of real examples at  different work situations where diversity caused some struggle and explains perfectly the context and expectation of each culture to avoid those kind of situations. Some cultures expect the boss to take the decision and they follow, some other cultures have a more horizontal approach but differ on how fast the decision is taken and how much flexibility there is once taken.

I found the book amazing because there were several situations described in the book I experienced in the past I struggled to understand.

**Practice Empathy**

I found this one quite interesting too. I wrote some words about it last month: [https://kuku.vercel.app/posts/empathic-research](https://kuku.vercel.app/posts/empathic-research)

**Empowered**

Interesting continuation by svpg to their previous book Inspired. It could be more or less useful based on your experience, but both of them are a must if you work in a company building digital products. 

**The ride of a Lifetime (Robert Iger)**

Autobiography of Disney CEO. It's interesting to read about the different acquistions he made like Pixar, Marvel, LucasArts, etc: but there is not much more than that inside.

**The Great Mental Models Volume 1: General Thinking Concepts**

I didn't like this one. I got a strong reaction against this book when I read it and I don't even remember really well why. I felt it was some phsicology bullshit for tech people. On the other hand a couple of friends really enjoy it, so it could be just me.

**Patria**

I read this one just before HBO released their tv show based on the book because of the hype. It was a hard book to read for me. As a basque it make me notice some behaviors I have when I was a teenager that I never tought about and maybe it wouldn't correct. Nevermind, it open a ton of interesting conversations with my friends about the basque conflict without the strong opinions brought by the news.

**La sombra del viento**

The book I read the fastest this year. I started it just when I moved to Barcelona and the story and the places made me imagine the city and their people in the past. It was a beautiful story that made me imagine how was the city and their people in the past. I really enjoyed it

**El juego del Ángel**

The second book of the triology. I loved the first one. I didn't like this second one much.

**Ensayo sobre la cegera**

Probably this year was the one where I read more non-fiction or non work related books. This was not my favourite but it was recommended to me by someone special and it would make a great apocaliptic tv show if you ask me.

**The Darkest Forest**

Second installment of the ultra popular sci-fi triology that I hope to finish this year. A lot has been writen about this books. A must.

**You Don't Know JS Yet**

I took several months off this year to study and travel (perfect timing). One of the things on my list was learning a bit more of JavaScript so I read some of the books of this collection and made some courses and projects. "Projects". I really enjoyed them.

Books I read more than half but I didn't finish

**Thinking in Systems**

This was one of the Factorial Book Club reads. It's one of this books that explains super interesting things but after a couple of pages my eyes starts closing. It explains how systems work and the different interconnections. Super interesting stuff, so it has to be how it's written (and probably ysing the same glyphs over an over)

**Obama**

I bought is an audiobook because it was narrated by Obama. I found really boring how he won all those elections before becoming President but in these times his voice calms me a lot and help me sleep a couple of days a week.

**Activate y cambia tu vida**

Lockdowns are hard.

**Database Internals**

My precious job was a lot about PosGres, BigQuery, Redshift, ... and databases. I want edto learn a bit more about their inner workings so I read this book.

**Eloquent Javascript, 3rd Edition: A Modern Introduction to Programming**

I started working before being able to finish it, but it's on my pending list for the beginning of this year.
